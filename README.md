# coding-drills
This repository is meant to help my friends _drill_-in programming concepts. You will find language-specific drills here. For the best results, please create a new project per prompt. 

For example, when following the javascript drills, your project directory will look like this.
```
coding-drills-folder/
  prompt-1/
    index.js
  prompt-2/
    index.js
  ...
```
> Repetition is the key to success.
